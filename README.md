# Low Level SSD1327 Library

Allows for drawing pixels and text to the Waveshare SSD1327 OLED module and similar displays using a full framebuffer. Note that using a complete framebuffer uses a lot of memory (8 KiB for the buffer alone), and as such, this library is unusable on AVR-based boards like the Uno and Mega. Recommended platforms include ARM-based boards (e.g. Arduino Due) and the ESP family (ESP8266 and ESP32 boards such as NodeMCU).

## Example Code

```cpp
